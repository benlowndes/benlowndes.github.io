  <h1 class="page-heading">Book Notes</h1>

  <p>I typically read books on my kindle and make heavy use of highlighting to select key passages.
    This allows me to then extract the highlighted notes in bulk by copying them from Amazon's <em>Your Kindle</em> site.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had been storing and reviewing these notes in Apple's Notes app, but in the spirit
    of sharing the value I find (and influenced by a similar endeavour by <a href="https://sivers.org/book">Derek Sivers</a>), I've move the notes to markdown and published
    them here via github pages. I hope you find them useful.

        Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink &amp; Leif Babin
    </a>
    <p>I first listened to this as an audiobook and found it to be full of such great,
    concise, and practical leadership advice that I soon purchased the ebook so I could
    extract the detailed notes I wanted from it.
    </p>
    <p>
    The book mixes in stories of combat in Iraq with leadership lessons transfered to
    the business world. I must admit I had a certain prejudice against this book and
    didn't expect to like it much less find it valuable but there's no denying there's some
    great advice in there. Highly recommended.
