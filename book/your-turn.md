This is a book about seeing the stuck, and getting unstuck. It's about realising that it's your turn, always your turn, and understanding that once you see the opportunity it's yours.

Most of all, it's about freedom and our almost automatic insistence on avoiding it at all costs.

There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing except avoiding the feeling of stupid. And stupid is a good thing.

Not everything has to be OK.

Perhaps it might be better for everything to be moving

Moving forward, with the generosity. Moving forward, with the willingness to live with the tension. Moving forward, learning as you go.

The person who fails the most, wins.

The safest dreams we experience all the dreams with no hype of coming true.
Concrete dreams, on the other hand, are based on effort and a keen sense of what is possible. Concrete dreams juxtapose the what ifs with the maybe, they expose  us to hope and to risk at the very same same time.

Living with the possible takes guts.

When it's you want, it's your turn. You open it. Your choice. Your freedom. Your responsibility

Change hurts. Do it anyway. It's personal and it matters.

It's possible to take your turn on purpose. To bring focus and intentionality to your life and to become the kind of person who matters.
It's possible to change your posture and your approach and your expectations and to choose to take you to show up on the regular basis, and to make magic daily.

Nexus, dream, connect, do

We fail to notice because we are busy keeping busy
We fail to dream because dreaming implies that we have to take a risk to realise our dream.
We fail to connect because we might get rejected.
And we fail to do because we haven't noticed, we haven't dreamed, and we haven't connected.

Great work is the result of seeking out tension, not avoiding it.

Develop a habit of showing up on a regular basis, of writing when it's time to write, raising your hand when asked, pitching in every single time. The habit is part of what it means to do work. Your posture of leaning into this opportunity, of connecting and creating and picking yourself: this is your work. How motivated you are to die has nothing to do with the opportunity and obligation you face.

Be a grown-up: the productive grown-up stops waiting for help and contributes  instead.

And what about getting in the mood? What about the motivation you need to engage in life? Our need for motivation is due to our need for reassurance. We are paralysed by fear that it might not work, and we let the fear at the demotivate us, giving us the perfect excuse to not create.

We need to learn to fix our own mood so we can be the one who fixes the rest of us. The mood fixer is a precious resource, and you can learn how to be that resource.

Do what you should. Your mood will follow.

We are capable of creating work that matters only if we're willing to be uncomfortable while doing it

We’ve been so terrified into believing in the importance of preparation that it’s spilled over into that other realm, the realm of life where we have no choice but to be unprepared.

The buy (or reject) a story, not you.

## Fear of failure
Consider our avoidance of feeling tired. If you’re unwilling to be tired, unwilling to feel fatigue in your legs, you can’t run a marathon.
If you’re not willing to imagine failure, you’re unable to be free.

The only way to make it as an artist is to do it from a position of generosity, of seeking to connect and change people for the better.

We wilfully create the illusion that we have no choice because it’s frightening to be free. But the deeper we look, the more we realise how much choice we actually have. The choice of which roads to take and, more profoundly, which ones we choose not to take.

Fierceness takes honesty and commitment. Fierceness means telling yourself the truth about what’s at stake and what’s possible, without expending a drop of energy trying to make everything ok.

## How much do you get paid to watch TV?

More important is the story we tell ourselves. A story of mattering, of resilience, of daring to take a turn. Your narrative belongs to you, and it’s up to you to create an olive a story that works.

## Write until you are not afraid to write
After you’ve written and written, then you get to decide. And if it’s not good enough to share, write again.

When fear arrives, do what you should do. Note the fear, welcome it if you can, but do what you should do.

The only reliable way to find our footing is to create it, to change the story we tell ourselves, to build an internal foundation that not only tolerates a crazy world filled with change, but embraces it.

## What will you create?
Who will you help?
What connection will you make?
What will you dare to care about?

There are so many opportunities, so many chances to find beauty or to ease suffering, that the easiest thing to do is to pretend they don’t exist.

What do you care enough to fix, or disrupt, or invent?

Starting right here, right now. If we are willing to suffer enough to matter, we are able to make change happen. Or at least we can try.

If each of us has a unique invented worldview, and that worldview keeps changing, why not change it on purpose? Why not invent a way of being that’s actually eager (not just comfortable, but eager) to live with the duality of work/not work, to embrace the freedom of living in a world where we’re not controlling every outcome and even sure about what’s going to happen next?

Creative, dynamic, and happy people have invented a monologue built around taking the work seriously, not personally, and in accepting that it will all be okay. Because, after all, what’s the alternative?

The good ones show up and say, “teach me.” - They are thirsty.

No place to hide is the only place to be.

## Where does thirst come from?
Thirst comes from culture.
Thirst comes from habits. The habit of asking why. The habit of shipping. The habit of leading.
It’s our obligation.

So why is everyone always talking about how to do important work, give talks, make a ruckus without the fear? Of course you’re going to feel afraid.

Celebrate this fear and this thrill, because it’s the dance you’re about to do that will make the work worth doing.

If acquired traits like resilience and persistence and generosity are more important than genes and talent, then who can we possibly point to when things don’t go well?

Being on the hook is a privilege. It means the people around us are trusting us to contribute, counting on us to deliver.

The easiest way to get something to move forward is to relentlessly give away credit for what you’ve created.
Soon people will want to work with you again.
The person who is responsible enough to be responsible discovers that it’s their turn more often.
