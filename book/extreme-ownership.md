## Extreme Ownership
Own everything: take full responsibility for success or failure. The leader bears full responsibility for explaining the strategic mission, developing the tactics, and securing the training and resources to  enable the team to properly and successfully execute.

## No bad teams, only bad leaders
Enforce high standards: it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. if there are no consequences—that poor performance becomes the new standard. Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mind-set into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team’s performance. Identifying weaknesses, good leaders seek to strengthen them and come up with a plan to overcome challenges. The best teams anywhere are constantly looking to improve, add capability, and push the standards higher. It starts with the individual and spreads to each of the team members until this becomes the culture, the new standard.

## Believe
The leader must align his thoughts and vision to that of the mission. Once a leader believes in the mission, that belief shines through to those below and above in the chain of command. Actions and words reflect belief with a clear confidence and self-assuredness that is not possible when belief is in doubt. They must impart this understanding to their teams down to the tactical-level operators on the ground. Leaders must take a step back, deconstruct the situation, analyze the strategic picture, and then come to a conclusion. If they cannot determine a satisfactory answer themselves, they must ask questions up the chain of command until they understand why.

## Check the ego
Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and operating with a high degree of humility. Admitting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team. Ego can prevent a leader from conducting an honest, realistic assessment of his or her own performance and the performance of the team.

## Cover and Move
It is the most fundamental tactic, perhaps the only tactic. Put simply, Cover and Move means teamwork. All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, mutually supporting one another for that singular purpose. Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them. If they forsake this principle and operate independently or work against each other, the results can be catastrophic to the overall team’s performance.

## Simple
Plans and orders must be communicated in a manner that is simple, clear, and concise. Everyone that is part of the mission must know and understand his or her role in the mission and what to do in the event of likely contingencies. As a leader, it doesn’t matter how well you feel you have presented the information or communicated an order, plan, tactic, or strategy. If your team doesn’t get it, you have not kept things simple and you have failed. You must brief to ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands. It is critical, as well, that the operating relationship facilitate the ability of the frontline troops to ask questions that clarify when they do not understand the mission or key tasks to be performed. Leaders must encourage this communication and take the time to explain so that every member of the team understands.

Through careful contingency planning, a leader can anticipate likely challenges that could arise during execution and map out an effective response to those challenges before they happen. That leader and his or her team are far more likely to win. Staying ahead of the curve prevents a leader from being overwhelmed when pressure is applied and enables greater decisiveness. If the team has been briefed and understands what actions to take through such likely contingencies, the team can then rapidly execute when those problems arise, even without specific direction from leaders. This is a critical characteristic of any high-performance, winning team in any business or industry.

## Prioritise and Execute
Senior leaders must help subordinate team leaders within their team prioritize their efforts. When priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain. Senior leaders must constantly communicate and push information—what we call in the military “situational awareness”—to their subordinate leaders. Likewise, junior leaders must push situational awareness up the chain to their senior leaders to keep them informed, particularly of crucial information that affects strategic decision making.

To implement Prioritize and Execute in any business, team, or organization, a leader must:
* evaluate the highest priority problem.
* lay out in simple, clear, and concise terms the highest priority effort for your team.
* develop and determine a solution, seek input from key leaders and from the team where possible.
* direct the execution of that solution, focusing all efforts and resources toward this priority task.
* move on to the next highest priority problem. Repeat.
* when priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain.
* don’t let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed.

## Decentralised Command
Teams must be broken down into manageable elements of four to five operators, with a clearly designated leader. Those leaders must understand the overall mission, and the ultimate goal of that mission—the Commander’s Intent. Junior leaders must be empowered to make decisions on key tasks necessary to accomplish that mission in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Teams within teams are organized for maximum effectiveness for a particular mission, with leaders who have clearly delineated responsibilities. Every tactical-level team leader must understand not just what to do but why they are doing it.

Likewise, junior leaders must push situational awareness up the chain to their senior leaders to keep them informed, particularly of crucial information that affects strategic decision making.

## Plan
A broad and ambiguous mission results in lack of focus, ineffective execution, and mission creep. To prevent this, the mission must be carefully refined and simplified so that it is explicitly clear and specifically focused to achieve the greater strategic vision for which that mission is a part.

The mission must explain the overall purpose and desired result, or “end state,” of the operation. The frontline troops tasked with executing the mission must understand the deeper purpose behind the mission. While a simple statement, the Commander’s Intent is actually the most important part of the brief. When understood by everyone involved in the execution of the plan, it guides each decision and action on the ground.

Leaders must delegate the planning process down the chain as much as possible to key subordinate leaders. Team leaders within the greater team and frontline, tactical-level leaders must have ownership of their tasks within the overall plan and mission.

Once the detailed plan has been developed, it must then be briefed to the entire team and all participants and supporting elements. Leaders must carefully prioritize the information to be presented in as simple, clear, and concise a format as possible so that participants do not experience information overload. The planning process and briefing must be a forum that encourages discussion, questions, and clarification from even the most junior personnel. If frontline troops are unclear about the plan and yet are too intimidated to ask questions, the team’s ability to effectively execute the plan radically decreases. Thus, leaders must ask questions of their troops, encourage interaction, and ensure their teams understand the plan.

A leader’s checklist for planning should include the following:
* Analyze the mission.
    * Understand higher headquarters’ mission, Commander’s Intent, and endstate (the goal).
    * Identify and state your own Commander’s Intent and endstate for the specific mission.
* Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available.
* Decentralize the planning process.
    * Empower key leaders within the team to analyze possible courses of action.
* Determine a specific course of action.
    * Lean toward selecting the simplest course of action.
    * Focus efforts on the best course of action.
* Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action.
* Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation.
* Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible.
* Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders.
    * Stand back and be the tactical genius.
* Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation.
* Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets.
    * Emphasize Commander’s Intent.
    * Ask questions and engage in discussion and interaction with the team to ensure they understand.
* Conduct post-operational debrief after execution.
    * Analyze lessons learned and implement them in future planning.

## Leading Up and Down the Chain of Command
If your boss isn’t making a decision in a timely manner or providing necessary support for you and your team, don’t blame the boss. First, blame yourself. Examine what you can do to better convey the critical information for decisions to be made and support allocated.

Leading up the chain of command requires tactful engagement with the immediate boss, to do this, a leader must push situational awareness up the chain of command.  Leading up the chain takes much more savvy and skill than leading down the chain.The subordinate leader must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication, and maintain the highest professionalism.

One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your own boss—your immediate leadership.
As a leader, if you don’t understand why decisions are being made, requests denied, or support allocated elsewhere, you must ask those questions up the chain. Then, once understood, you can pass that understanding down to your team.

The major factors to be aware of when leading up and down the chain of command are these:
* Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world, subordinates and superiors alike.
* If someone isn’t doing what you want or need them to do, look in the mirror first and determine what you can do to better enable this.
* Don’t ask your leader what you should do, tell them what you are going to do.

## Decisiveness amid Uncertainty
There is no 100 percent right solution. The picture is never complete. Leaders must be comfortable with this and be able to make decisions promptly, then be ready to adjust those decisions quickly based on evolving situations and new information. Intelligence gathering and research are important, but they must be employed with realistic expectations and must not impede swift decision making that is often the difference between victory and defeat. Waiting for the 100 percent right and certain solution leads to delay, indecision, and an inability to execute. Leaders must be prepared to make an educated guess based on previous experience, knowledge of how the enemy operates, likely outcomes, and whatever intelligence is available in the immediate moment.

## Discipline equals freedom
The Dichotomy of Leadership
A good leader must be:
* confident but not cocky;
* courageous but not foolhardy;
* competitive but a gracious loser;
* attentive to details but not obsessed by them;
* strong but have endurance;
* a leader and follower;
* humble not passive;
* aggressive not overbearing;
* quiet not silent;
* calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions;
* close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that they forget who is in charge.
* able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command.
